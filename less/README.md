`THE PROCESS...`
<!-- My team was to create an (web)app where women in Africa's  marketplaces can sign up and manage inventory as well as compare prices to others' in their region. My particular job was to come up with the UI of the main page, 'marketing page' and an about page with the projects team members on it. The given responsive requirements were that as the page were scaled it looked good at 500px, 800px, and above 1000px. LESS' escapinng method was used to achieve responsiveness, along with percentages and rems as opposed to hardcoding with pixels. Speaking of LESS, seperate .less files were used for seperate sections of the pages and imported into index.less. With LESS I was able to utilize Parametric mixins, variables and nesting to achieve our teams desired look. All in all, the process was smooth, the team stayed in communication, elements were tested and re-tested, and critiques were given. We did well my team we did. -->
